#this codebook described the Raw and tidy data set ##Part 1 Describes the Raw data source

Here is the Raw data URL: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Below is URL for Raw Dataset description: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

##Part 2 Described the Tidy data Tidy data can be read directly using below R script

tidydata <- read.table("./tidydata.txt")

the resulting tidy data consists of 180 observations and 81 variables.
the resulting tidy data is ordered based on subject_id & activity_id.
the resulting Tidy data is the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Column 1 "subjecNumber": is a numeric identifier of the subject who performed the activity

Column 2 "activity": identifies the id of activity performed by the subjects. It's a factor variable

Columns 3 to 81: these are all numeric variables and represent measurements taken using the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial when the subject moved. Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation have been included.

##part 3 defines the data main files

'features.txt': List of all features.
'activity.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
